Android sample project to showcase all the concepts explained in **Managing your android app iconography** [article](https://medium.com/makingtuenti/managing-your-android-app-iconography-a2f4aa9cb49d)

The app is very simple, a set of imageviews that reference vectorDrawable assets using theme attributes to set their color. The goal is to showcase, how using a single vector asset we can easily restyle it automatically to different app themes or app variants.

See demo:
