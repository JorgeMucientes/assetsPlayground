# assetsPlayground
Android sample project to play around with vector drawables and theme attributes in different ways

The app is very simple, a set of imageviews that reference vectorDrawable assets using theme attributes to set their color. The goal is to showcase how using a single vector asset we can easily restyle it automatically to the app theme o build variant. 

See demo:
